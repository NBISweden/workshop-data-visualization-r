In this chapter, we will mainly focus on making a "publication-type" figure, with sub-plots and such using different tools in R. There are many different ways/packages to do this, but we will mainly focus on 2 packages: `cowplot` and `ggpubr`.

Now let us consider some of the plots we have made so far in the previous exercises. From the picture below, **A** and **B** are the figures that was made from the `gene counts` dataset and the figures **C** and **D** are using the `Sepal.Length` and `Sepal.Width` from the `iris` data. Now let us look into how we can combine each of the figures like it is shown here. 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, echo=FALSE, fold.plot=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(reshape2)
data("iris")
gc <- read.table("data/counts_raw.txt", header = T, row.names = 1, sep = "\t")
md <- read.table("data/metadata.csv", header = T, sep = ";")
rownames(md) <- md$Sample_ID

library(tidyverse)
gc_long <- gc %>%
  rownames_to_column(var = "Gene") %>%
  gather(Sample_ID, count, -Gene) %>% 
  full_join(md, by = "Sample_ID") %>% 
  select(Sample_ID, everything()) %>% 
  select(-c(Gene,count), c(Gene,count)) 
gc_long$Sample_Name <- factor(gc_long$Sample_Name, levels = c("t0_A","t0_B","t0_C","t2_A","t2_B","t2_C","t6_A","t6_B","t6_C","t24_A","t24_B","t24_C"))
gc_long$Time <- factor(gc_long$Time, levels = c("t0","t2","t6","t24"))
gc_long$Replicate <- factor(gc_long$Replicate, levels = c("A","B","C"))

se <- function(x) sqrt(var(x)/length(x))

p1 <- gc_long %>% 
  group_by(Time, Replicate) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(log10(count +1)),se=se(log10(count +1))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Time, y= mean, fill = Replicate)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), position = position_dodge2(.9, padding = .6)) +
  ylab("mean(log10(count+1))") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

p2 <- ggplot(data = gc_long) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Sample_Name, y = log10(count + 1), fill = Replicate)) +
  facet_grid(~Time , scales = "free", space = "free") +
  xlab("Time") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())

p3 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length))+
  geom_density(aes(fill = Species), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_light(base_size = 10)

p4 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_light(base_size = 10)

library(cowplot)
plot_grid(p1, p2, p3, p4, nrow = 2, labels = c("A", "B", "C", "D"))
```

Now, let us go step by step. First let us make these plots into R objects. This will make things a lot easier.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
p1 <- gc_long %>% 
  group_by(Time, Replicate) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(log10(count +1)),se=se(log10(count +1))) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x= Time, y= mean, fill = Replicate)) + 
  geom_col(position = position_dodge2()) +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=mean-se, ymax=mean+se), position = position_dodge2(.9, padding = .6)) +
  ylab("mean(log10(count+1))") +
  theme(axis.ticks = element_blank()) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10)

p2 <- ggplot(data = gc_long) +
  geom_boxplot(mapping = aes(x = Sample_Name, y = log10(count + 1), fill = Replicate)) +
  facet_grid(~Time , scales = "free", space = "free") +
  xlab("Time") +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) +
  theme(axis.ticks.x = element_blank(), axis.text.x = element_blank())

p3 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length))+
  geom_density(aes(fill = Species), alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_light(base_size = 10)

p4 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_light(base_size = 10)
```

The objects `p1`, `p2`, `p3` and `p4` as intuitively represent the plots **A**, **B**, **C** and **D** repectively. 

# Cowplot

## plot_grid

One can use the simple `plot_grid()` function from the `cowplot`.

```{r}
library(cowplot)
plot_grid(p1, p2)
```

You can also do some simple customizations using `nrow` or `ncol` to specify the number of rows and columns and provide `labels` to those plots as well.  

```{r}
plot_grid(p1, p2, nrow = 2, labels = c("A", "B"))
```

## ggdraw and draw_plot

In `cowplot`, you can also customize the dimentions of the plots in a much more controlled fashion. For this one starts with `ggdraw()` which initiates the drawing "canvas" followed by `draw_plot()` that you use to draw the different plots on to the canvas. 

Here is how the dimentions of the empty canvas looks like:
![](assets/images/canva.png)

From here, you can draw your plots in the way you want using these dimensions. AN example is shown below, where we plot **C** and **D** similar to the plot above: 

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(p3, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = .5) +
  draw_plot(p4, x = 0, y = .5, width = 1, height = .5) 
```

You can also add "labels" to these figures using `draw_plot_label()` with the same dimensions.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(p3, x = 0, y = 0.5, width = 1, height = .5) +
  draw_plot(p4, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = .5) +
  draw_plot_label(label = c("A", "B"), size = 15, x = c(0,0), y = c(1, 0.5))
```

It is easier to draw three (or any odd number) plots in a neat way using this function compared to `plot_grid()`

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggdraw() +
  draw_plot(p3, x = 0, y = 0.5, width = 0.5, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot(p4, x = 0.5, y = 0.5, width = 0.5, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot(p2, x = 0, y = 0, width = 1, height = 0.5) +
  draw_plot_label(label = c("A", "B", "C"), size = 15, x = c(0,0.5,0), y = c(1, 1,0.5))
```

# ggpubr

## ggarrange

The package `ggpubr` comes with quite a few functions that can be very useful to make comprehensive figures. To start with the simple function, let's start with `ggarrange()` that is used to put plots together.

```{r}
library(ggpubr)
ggarrange(p3, p4, labels = c("A", "B"), nrow = 2)
```

One of the nicer things with `ggarrange()` is that you can automatically have common legends that are shared between the figures.

```{r}
ggarrange(p3, p4, labels = c("A", "B"), nrow = 2, common.legend = TRUE, legend = "right")
```

## Mixing text and table with Figures

You can include tables and even normal texts to any figure using  `ggtexttable()` and `ggparagraph()`. Let us look into adding a table that we saw in the previous exercise with the `gene counts` dataset.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
gc_table <- gc_long %>% 
  group_by(Time) %>% 
  summarise(mean=mean(log10(count +1)),se=se(log10(count +1)))

tab1 <- ggtexttable(gc_table, rows = NULL, 
                        theme = ttheme("mOrange"))
gc_text <- paste("In the experiment, RNA was extracted at four time points:", 
                 "before the gefinitib treatment (t=0), and two, six and twenty-four hours",
                 "after treatment (t=2, t=6, t=24, respectively).", sep = " ")

tex1 <- ggparagraph(text = gc_text, face = "italic", size = 11, color = "black")

```

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note &nbsp; Here, for the `text` part, `paste()` has been used just to make it a bit easier to show here in the code. It could be used without the `paste()` command as well.

```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
ggarrange(ggarrange(p1, p2, nrow = 2, labels = c("A", "B"), common.legend = TRUE, legend = "top"),
          ggarrange(tab1, tex1, nrow = 2),
          ncol = 2,
          widths = c(2, 1))
```

## Multiple-page

With `ggarrange()` it is also possible to make multiple-page plots. If you are for example making a report of many different figures this can come quite handy. Then you can use `ggexport()` to export these figures in a multi-page `pdf`. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
multi.page <- ggarrange(p1, p2, p3, p4,
                        nrow = 1, ncol = 1)
ggexport(multi.page, filename = "multi.page.ggplot2.pdf")
```

<i class="fas fa-exclamation-circle"></i> Note &nbsp; From this `multi.page` R object (which is of class list) , you can get the indivdual plots by `multi.page[[1]]`, `multi.page[[2]]` and so on.

# Exercise

<i class="fas fa-clipboard-list"></i> Task &nbsp; For the exercise in this session, let us look into way of using the tools available for combining plots to make one plot that could be very comprehensive. Try to code the figure below:

```{r, fold.plot=FALSE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
p4 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(x=Sepal.Length, y = Sepal.Width, color = Species)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
  border() 

d1 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(Sepal.Length, fill = Species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_classic() +
  clean_theme() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

d2 <- ggplot(data=iris,mapping=aes(Sepal.Width, fill = Species)) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.6) +
  theme_classic() +
  clean_theme() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  rotate()

ggarrange(d1, NULL, p4, d2, 
          ncol = 2, nrow = 2,  align = "hv", 
          widths = c(3, 1), heights = c(1, 3),
          common.legend = TRUE)
```

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip: 1 &nbsp; Within `ggarrange()`, it is possible to adjust the dimension of each plot with `widths` and `heights` options. 

<i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Tip: 2 &nbsp; You can plot an empty plot with `NULL`.
