:::{.callout-caution title="Download course files"}

Please download all the necessary files from [here](https://nbisweden.github.io/workshop-data-visualization-r/2505/topics/lab_download.html) and make sure that the directory tree looks similar to the one displayed in that page.

## {{< fa brands markdown >}} HackMD

We will use the online note-keeping document from HackMD for our questions. Please click [here](https://hackmd.io/@g4wu57tQRzSqYwnAPalt0Q/HJbAkaTXq) to see the notebook. We would appreciate it a lot if you could write your questions and feedback here, so that all participants can learn from each other.

## {{< fa brands docker >}} Docker

If you are more familiar with using `Docker`, all the tools necessary for the course are available as a Docker image. You can pull the image using the following command:

```
docker pull ghcr.io/nbisweden/workshop-adv-data-viz:latest
```

If you would like to try to install `Docker` and give it a try, please follow the instructions [here](other/docker.html)

### {{< fa brands microsoft >}} Visual Studio code

The best and most efficient way to work with the Docker image is with `VScode` and the extension `Dev Containers`. Similar to `RStudio` or `Posit`, `VScode` is an IDE maintained by Microsoft and it is quite efficient and robust for all Operating systems. 

 - To install VScode, follow the instructions [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/setup-overview)
 - After successful installation of VScode and Docker, you can install the `Dev Containers` extension for VScode from [here](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)
 - Download the `Dev Container` file from [here](https://github.com/NBISweden/workshop-data-visualization-r/raw/main/dev-container-file/.devcontainer.json) *Make sure that all the course related files are in the same place as this `.devcontainer.json` hidden file*
 - Then in `VScode`, press `Ctrl+Shift+P` (`Cmd+Shift+P` for Mac users) followed by  `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container` to select the folder where you have all the files or `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`, if you are already on VScode in the same directory.
 - Now, if everything worked fine, a new window shoudl appear inside the `Advanced Data Visualization` container.
