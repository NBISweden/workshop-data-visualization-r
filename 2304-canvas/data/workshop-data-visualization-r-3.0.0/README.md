:exclamation: When updating repo for a new course, change `output_dir: XXXX` in `_site.yml` as the first thing, so that old rendered files are not overwritten.

:exclamation: Do not push any rendered .html files or intermediates.

## Repo organisation

The source material is located on the *main* branch (default). The rendered material is located on the *gh-pages* branch. For most part, one only needs to update content in master. Changes pushed to the *main* branch is automatically rendered to the *gh-pages* branch.

:exclamation: The first build can take around 30-40 mins depending on the number of R packages (listed in **_site.yml**). Subsequent builds take about 2-3 minutes since caching is enabled. Caches are removed after 7 days of last access. A push after that will require a full rebuild.
